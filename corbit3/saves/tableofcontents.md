=================
This here is where all the saves are kept. The saves are in JSON, and contain all the data
that could change between different states of the program. Plus a couple things, like color
and name. But stuff that Iâ€™ve chosen to keep out of here includes:

+ specific impulse of habitats
+ fuel usage of habitats

I simply hardcode these in `corbit3/corbit/entity.py`
